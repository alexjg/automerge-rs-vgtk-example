# Automerge vgtk example

This is a simple example of using automerge-rs with vgtk. Right now it depends on automerge-rs being located at `../automerge-rs` with respect to this project. It also depends on a few bugfixes which I have not pushed yet. Basically, it won't build, but I'll fix that soon.
